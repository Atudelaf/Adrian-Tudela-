## 🚀 **About Me**  
Passionate about bridging gaps between data and decision-making, I leverage **Jira**, **Trello**, **SQL**, and **PowerBI** to deliver actionable insights. With a knack for visualization (Figma, PowerBI) and automation (Python, JS), I turn chaos into structured workflows. I have a Master in Business Administration and Bachelor`s degree in industrial engineering with 3+ years of experience in product/project management, business planning, acquisitions, and logistics. I acquired knowledge in finance management, merchandising and business analytics.
